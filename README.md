# Release

This repository contains the website I use to present myself and my company, Release.

It is based on several technologies, and build from a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) template.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - the official Tailwind CSS documentation
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) - the official Next.js documentation
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev) - the official Headless UI documentation
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) - the MDX documentation
